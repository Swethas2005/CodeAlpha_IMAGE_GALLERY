## Project Overview

This project is a basic image gallery web application that allows users to view a collection of images with simple navigation controls. It's built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive functionality.

## Features

- Displays a collection of images in a gallery layout.
- Users can navigate through images using next and previous buttons.
- Includes a fade effect when transitioning between images.
- Navigation buttons are disabled appropriately when at the beginning or end of the gallery.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the gallery and enhancing its visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing interactive features such as image navigation and fade effects.
